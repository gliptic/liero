/* _ieee754_pow(x,y) return x**y
 *
 *		      n
 * Method:  Let x =  2   * (1+f)
 *	1. Compute and return log2(x) in two pieces:
 *		log2(x) = w1 + w2,
 *	   where w1 has 53-24 = 29 bit trailing zeros.
 *	2. Perform y*log2(x) = n+y' by simulating muti-precision
 *	   arithmetic, where |y'|<=0.5.
 *	3. Return x**y = 2**n*fd_exp(y'*log2)
 *
 * Special cases:
 *	1.  (anything) ** 0  is 1
 *	2.  (anything) ** 1  is itself
 *	3.  (anything) ** NAN is NAN
 *	4.  NAN ** (anything except 0) is NAN
 *	5.  +-(|x| > 1) **  +INF is +INF
 *	6.  +-(|x| > 1) **  -INF is +0
 *	7.  +-(|x| < 1) **  +INF is +0
 *	8.  +-(|x| < 1) **  -INF is +INF
 *	9.  +-1         ** +-INF is NAN
 *	10. +0 ** (+anything except 0, NAN)               is +0
 *	11. -0 ** (+anything except 0, NAN, odd integer)  is +0
 *	12. +0 ** (-anything except 0, NAN)               is +INF
 *	13. -0 ** (-anything except 0, NAN, odd integer)  is +INF
 *	14. -0 ** (odd integer) = -( +0 ** (odd integer) )
 *	15. +INF ** (+anything except 0,NAN) is +INF
 *	16. +INF ** (-anything except 0,NAN) is +0
 *	17. -INF ** (anything)  = -0 ** (-anything)
 *	18. (-anything) ** (integer) is (-1)**(integer)*(+anything**integer)
 *	19. (-anything except 0 and inf) ** (non-integer) is NAN
 *
 * Accuracy:
 *	fd_pow(x,y) returns x**y nearly rounded. In particular
 *			fd_pow(integer,integer)
 *	always returns the correct integer provided it is
 *	representable.
 *
 * Constants :
 * The hexadecimal values are the intended ones for the following
 * constants. The decimal values may be used, provided that the
 * compiler will convert from decimal to binary accurately enough
 * to produce the hexadecimal values shown.
